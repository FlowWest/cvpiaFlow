The csv's in this directory are saved output from 2020D09EDV.dss provided by Mike Wright in October 2017.
All the nodes from part C = 'FLOW-CHANNEL' or 'FLOW-DELIVERY' and part B starting with a 'C' or 'D' were copied
into several csv's because the HEC viewer would crash when attempting to export all these nodes at once.
The 'clean_calsim.R' file is a script that will select the nodes of interest defined in 'cvpia_calsim_nodes.csv'
and rename them to fit the needs of generating model inputs for the SIT model.
