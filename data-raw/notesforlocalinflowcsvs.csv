Watershed,LocalInflow CalLite node,"CalSim II arc (I arcs in SV have C arcs exactly equal in DV that I'm using instead, but many non-DSM I arcs contributing to local inflow are pulled from SV in the specific csvs)",Notes,Adapted from the Google Doc (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FpO5moi003WxAz0-RqLlGkueru8lzsOtWV94rKkpzsc) as of about 1 PM 100417. I'm ignoring R_ (recharge) arcs but they're generally very small
Antelope Creek,WilkinsSlough,C11307,Accretions to Wilkins Slough,
Battle Creek,RedBluff,C10803,Accretions to Red Bluff,
Bear Creek,????,????,"mjw: No representation in CalSim II?? Can't find it on schematic and searching through CSII source code only brings up Bear Creek Refuge info, which is in the Merced River area. Maybe correlate to nearby creek(s) like Cow?",
Big Chico Creek,WilkinsSlough,C11501,Accretions to Wilkins Slough,
Butte Creek,????,????,Unclear - may be showing at SacFeather as an accretion? Node 217. mjw: could treat as fraction of localinflow to SacFeather?,

Stony Creek,WilkinsSlough,C142A,Accretions to Wilkins Slough. Mjw: PROBLEM for C142A; fairly frequent 0s. Upriver Stony Creek C_ arcs also have 0s… the I* arcs that flow into CalSim II's modeled reservoirs on Stony Creek also have 0s in common…,

Bear River,YubaFeather,C282,Need to back out flows as acretions to Yuba-Feather node,
Cosumnes River,Eastside,C501,"Referred to as rim inflows. Takes 504 as a time series (confluence of Moke and Cosumnes). May need to use gage data to tease out flow splits. 504 is fictional confluence, 501/504",
Mokelumne River,Eastside,I504,"Referred to as rim inflows. Takes 504 as a time series (confluence of Moke and Cosumnes). May need to use gage data to tease out flow splits. Mjw: No C503 in non-EBMUD-module CSII, replaced by I504…",
