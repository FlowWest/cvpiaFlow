Watershed,LocalInflow CalLite node,"CalSim II arc (I arcs in SV have C arcs exactly equal in DV that I'm using instead, but many non-DSM I arcs contributing to local inflow are pulled from SV in the specific csvs)",Notes,Adapted from the Google Doc (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FpO5moi003WxAz0-RqLlGkueru8lzsOtWV94rKkpzsc) as of about 1 PM 100417. I'm ignoring R_ (recharge) arcs but they're generally very small

Bear Creek,NA,average of C10801 and C10803???,"mjw: Leaving it to FlowWest to develop a basis for creating this time series, since we don't have anything for it from either CalLite-CV or CalSim II. If there's a gauge, it could be compared to a gauge on Cow or Battle Creek and the ratio used to create a Bear Creek time series out of C10801 or C10803 (Cow and Battle Creeks in CalSim II); alternately we could just use one of those two, or an average (it seems like Bear Creek is between the two other ones so their watersheds are probably going to respond fairly similarly to the weather... right?)",
Big Chico Creek,WilkinsSlough,C11501,Accretions to Wilkins Slough,
Butte Creek,NA,I217,"Unclear - may be showing at SacFeather as an accretion? Node 217. mjw: I217 is the best record we have and we don't have a clear rationale for creating a LocalInflow split in this part of the river, so just use it. Assume it's a fraction of SacFeather.LocalInflow; we aren't using that LocalInflow, so nothing else needs to change and mass balance is not affected.",

Cosumnes River,Eastside,C501,"Referred to as rim inflows. Takes 504 as a time series (confluence of Moke and Cosumnes). May need to use gage data to tease out flow splits. 504 is fictional confluence, 501/504",
Mokelumne River,Eastside,I504,"Referred to as rim inflows. Takes 504 as a time series (confluence of Moke and Cosumnes). May need to use gage data to tease out flow splits. Mjw: No C503 in non-EBMUD-module CSII, replaced by I504…",
North Delta,Hood.Outflow,NA,"Using SacAmerican.Outflow would set this identical to the Lower American flow, so I'm using Hood.Outflow to at least include some of the North Delta's local inflows as well and make them non-identical. The North Delta, conveniently, has only one inflow in the CalLite-CV representation",
Central Delta,Eastside.Outflow + DCC.Diversion,NA,"Treating this as its own element for now since I'm not sure about the details of implementation. The inflow is Eastside tributaries plus Delta Cross Channel flows when applicable. CentralDelta.Inflow itself has an extra term that seems to be zeroed out but just in case it ever un-zeroes without us noticing it, let's do this sum ourselves.",
South Delta,SJR_Calaveras.Outflow + SJR_FlowSplit.C417B + CentralDelta.Outflow,NA,"Takes as inflow both Central Delta outflow and the two southern arcs, one representing San Joaquin flow going up the Old and Middle River, the other representing the combination of San Joaquin flow in its mainstem and the Calaveras River. If the Central Delta is part of the South Delta for some or all DSM purposes, just replace CentralDelta.Outflow here with the records named in cell B19",
