"date is the CalLite-CV date column, the next column with the name of a CalLite-CV element is the LocalInflow data from the CT_noCC run for the CalLite-CV element from which we're going to be deriving these DSM stream flow time series in cfs (I couldn't find an output file in the Basin Study documentation for this like I did for the Outflow data in the master csv but spot checks indicated that the GoldSim model file I'm pulling these from have identical data to those outputs), cs_date is for my reference to avoid screwing up the 10/2014=10/1925 matching and it sounds like you can use it for something too, and the CalSim II records corresponding to the local inflows to the CalLite-CV element are listed afterward (I've got them in cfs now, to match the CalLite-CV data). 'matches for other csvs.csv' contains the mappings between the DSM streams and CalSim II elements, as a one-stop summary for which DSM streams are showing up in which specific .csvs like this one. I renamed the CalSim II elements that map to DSM streams in this csv; everything that still has a CalSim II name is one of the elements that contributes to the total (the denominator) but is NOT a DSM stream. The CalSim II run I'm using at the moment is the most recent representation of current operations I've received; probably we'll be choosing a different baseline in the future but the matches csv mentioned above contains the CalSim II match for DSM streams, so I can go back and re-pull those time series if/when necessary. C17603 is Sites Reservoir outflows into the Sacramento in this region; it's zeroed out in the run I'm using but that should be re-checked if a different run is used. NOTE that matching 2014 to 1925 results in the last ~7 years of the CalLite-CV run not having an equivalent CS2 number... EXAMPLE CALCULATION: For 10/2014, Elder Creek has 13.8 cfs, the total of all WiSl inflows sum(D3:M3)=550.4, and 13.8/550.4=0.025155, the fraction of total CalSim II inflow in Elder Creek. Applying that fraction to the CalLite-CV WilkinsSlough LocalInflow number we get Elder Creek DSM flow = 0.25155*189.9=4.78 cfs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
