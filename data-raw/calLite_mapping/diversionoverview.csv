Watershed,CalLite-CV Node(s)/CalSim arc(s),Notes,Overall Notes
Upper Sacramento River,D104/C109,"Reservoir element doesn't have any diversions in CalLite-CV and the next element downriver is already being used, so I took the CalSim II arcs mentioned in PM  for 'Sacramento River up to Bend Bridge' instead. If this reach doesn't go down to Bend Bridge we could choose a different C arc as the denominator","Copied the first 14 DSM reaches/watersheds from notesformastercsv_flow.csv, which came from a Google Doc linked there. The same CalLite-CV node used to match for Outflows can be used as the basis for the calculation of fraction diverted; in fact, because water flows into the node and is split betwteen the Outflow and Diversion nodes, our calculation will be Diversion/(Diversion+Outflow). ""PM"" indicates that this reach had ""NA"" for its diversions in Proposed Mapping, so we won't be calculating diversions for it"

I WILL, for now, since there's nothing else here, but please note this discrepancy! All the CalSim II D* arcs in the area are in the CalLite-CV element either up- or downstream from this one, so using CalSim II numbers from PM would be double-dipping. For some reason SacFeather.SacFeather_Refuge_Diversion is in TAF; SacFeather_Refuge_Diversion_ch represents the conversion to cfs.",

Antelope Creek,(D11305 * 0.13)/C11307,PM,"Copied the next 16 DSM reaches/watersheds from notesforlocalinflowcsvs.csv; in these cases we don't have a CalLite-CV match, so we'll be using the CalSim II arcs listed in Mike Urkov's Proposed Mapping sheet to get a fraction of flow diverted in each month and apply that multiplier to the CalLite-CV-derived flow estimates. The fraction/multiplier will be calculated as [CalSim arcs for Diversion in Proposed Mapping]/[CalSim arcs for Flow in Proposed Mapping], unlike the case for CalLite-CV diversion calculations, because the CalLite-CV data we're using divides a pool of inflow into Diversion and Outflow while the CalSim II arcs chosen seek to represent the flow into an area and the diversions out of it. ""PM"" indicates that I took the CalSim II arcs from the Proposed Mapping sheet."

North Delta,(Hood.Diversion + RioVista.Diversion + RioVista.Diversion2)/(Hood.Diversion + RioVista.Diversion + RioVista.Diversion2 + Hood.Outflow + RioVista.Outflow),"Not including DCC because its 'diversion' is the inflow to the Central Delta. Hood.Diversion is always 0; should we calculate this without Hood.Outflow too? I think we should, just using the Rio Vista elements.","The Delta DSM reaches get their diversions from the summed Diversion elements in all the CalLite-CV nodes used to represent that part of the Delta. Like the other CalLite-CV work, this uses the calculation [sum of Diversions]/([sum of Diversions] + [sum of Outflows]) to calculate the fraction. I'm assuming there's no Central Delta and I'm lumping that area into the South Delta."

It's in the container that contains the sub-containers like RioVista, CentralDelta, DCC, etc., that I've been talking about; there's a Diversion element there that includes Banks, Tracy, and a few other outflows from Rio Vista and the South Delta. I'm not sure how to deal with that; for now I have NOT included those exports. Also similarly to the above, SJR1.Diversion is always 0 so maybe remove that and SJR1.Outflow?",
