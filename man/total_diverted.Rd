\description{
A dataset containing the diverted flow in cfs within watersheds for
use with the CVPIA Science Integration Team Decision Support Model.
}
\details{
The proportion diverted was calculated using 'FLOW-CHANNEL' and 'FLOW-DELIVERY' nodes from CALSIM II.
The nodes and calculation for each watershed are outlined above.

The diversions of Antelope Creek, Deer Creek and Mill Creek are represented by one diversion node.
Diversions for these creeks were estimated in proportion to their flow. Elder Creek and Thomes Creek
are also represented with a single node and their diversions were estimated using the same method.

*Mokelumne River flow and diversions are from a separate model provided by EBMUD.

The CALSIM II run is a Reclamation product used to replicate current operations for comparison
with proposed adjustments under an ongoing Endangered Species Act consultation with the National Marine
Fisheries Service. A current NMFS Biological Opinion concluded that, as proposed, CVP and SWP operations
were likely to jeopardize the continued existence of four federally- listed anadromous fish species:
Sacramento River winter-run Chinook salmon, Central Valley spring-run Chinook salmon, California Central Valley
steelhead, and the Southern distinct population segment of the North American green sturgeon. This CALSIM II
run was used as the basis of comparison for other potential operations that could offset impacts to listed species.
